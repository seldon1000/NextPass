# NextPass
NextPass is an Android client for Passwords (https://git.mdns.eu/nextcloud/passwords), a simple yet feature-rich password manager for Nextcloud.


# Build and run
NextPass is built entirely using Jetpack Compose toolkit, hence Android Studio Artic Fox (currently Canary branch) is **required** to build the app without issues.
