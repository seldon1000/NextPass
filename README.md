# NextPass
NextPass is an Android client for Passwords (https://git.mdns.eu/nextcloud/passwords), a simple yet feature-rich password manager for Nextcloud. It's still in development and will receive further updates.


# Build and run
NextPass is built entirely using Jetpack Compose toolkit, hence Android Studio Artic Fox (currently Canary branch) and Kotlin >=1.4.32 are **required** to build the app without issues.
Just import the project from Version Control, let Gradle do its (endless) magic and then build&run. Nextcloud app is required by NextPass to work and communicate with the Nextcloud server.
